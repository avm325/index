                <p> Will is a computer science major. Once he graduates his dream job is to work at a large tech 
                    company as a software engineer. He’s really hard-working, probably more hardworking than he 
                    gets credit for. His parents taught him to be kind, respectful and polite, which is 
                    something he’s grateful for. Interviewing Will was a really pleasant experience. I got to learn 
                    so many new and even unexpected things about him. Each time I asked him a question, it prompted 
                    quiet contemplation and a thoughtful answer, no matter how ridiculous my question was.

                    it’s a basic answer) and that his favorite color is blue. When I asked Will what his favorite fruit was he 
                    paused to look up a list of fruit before answering bananas. That really amused me. Moments like that are
                     what add the spice to life, so I’m glad Will did that.</td>

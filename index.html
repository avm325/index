                <p> Will Morano is from Jefferson Hills, a medium sized town in the suburbs of Pittsburgh. He said he feels pretty neutral about it. Before our interview Will seemed like a pretty neutral guy, in a good way but he’s actually a pretty neutral guy in a cool and unexpected way. He doesn't get irrational or easily upset and he approaches obstacles in a cool and level-headed manner. If I had to choose one color that would best describe Will, it would be blue, which is coincidentally his favorite color: a calming deep blue. Will is a computer science major. Once he graduates his dream job is to work at a large tech company as a software engineer. He’s really hard-working, probably more hardworking than he probably gets credit for. His parents taught him to be kind, respectful and polite, which is something he’s grateful for. Interviewing Will was a really pleasant experience. I got to learn so many new and even unexpected things about him. Each time I asked him a question, it prompted quiet contemplation and a thoughtful answer, no matter how ridiculous my question was which I really appreciated.

            <td>Want to know something really interesting? Will has a twin sister AND she attends Lehigh! 
                I would have never guessed that Will was a twin, he’s full of unexpected surprises. Welllll….. 
                except that his favorite movie is Inception (he feels like it’s a basic answer) and that his 
                favorite color is blue (basically everyone’s favorite color is blue). When I asked Will what his 
                favorite fruit was he paused to look up a list of fruit before answering bananas. That really amused 
                me. Moments like that are what add the spice to life, so I’m glad Will did that. One thing that me 
                and Will have in common is that our most respected Renaissance artist is Michelangelo, which is 
                something that I can commend Will for; Michelangelo was a really respectable guy. I asked Will 
                what kind of soup he would swim in if he had to and he answered a chicken dumpling soup which 
                I thought was kind of cool since my mom makes really good chicken dumpling soup. Can you tell 
                I’m really tired right now? Anyway, these are the kind of questions that let you see into 
                someone’s personality. I also asked Will what franchise he would live in and I kid you not 
                I knew he would say Harry Potter, but he also said he would live in the Inheritance Cycle world 
                which I didn’t know about. 
            </td>
            <td style="color:#020053"> fffffffffffffffffff<br>f<br>f</td>
            <td>After all of the basic and silly questions we started to get deep. Will would have his ashes spread 
                in California's Redwood Forest, but if he had to have them spread on campus he would have them 
                spread on the top floor of Rauch since nobody is up there. Will is the type of person to seek 
                peace. If he had to live in a fruit he would live in a pineapple to pay homage to Spongebob.
                 His supernatural pet of choice is a ghost, but it would have to be cute and passive. Back to the 
                 deep stuff. Will’s most treasured possession is his macbook because it hold everything, its basically 
                 the catalyst of his dreams for the future since he’s a CS major which I think is so interesting. I 
                 asked Will what he would name his children and he said that if he has a son it would be Miles or Milo, 
                 I already respected will before that answer but this reinforced my respect for him. Will would not go to 
                 space if there was a 40% chance he would die. Anyway, basically I think Will is really cool and I think 
                 he’s going to be really successful as he continues at Lehigh and beyond. I just have a hunch. </td>
